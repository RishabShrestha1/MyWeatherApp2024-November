## Dependencies üì¶

The app leverages the following packages:

1. **[flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) (v2.0.16)**  
   - Enables rendering of SVG images as the `Image` widget does not support SVGs natively.

2. **[flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) (v8.1.6)**, **[bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) (v8.1.4)**, **[equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) (v2.0.7)**  
   - Used for state management, ensuring a scalable and maintainable app architecture.

3. **[hive_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_flutter) (v1.1.0)**, **[hydrated_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/hydrated_bloc) (v9.1.5)**, **[path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) (v2.1.5)**  
   - Facilitates local storage for location retention. While Hive is my go-to solution, I experimented with **Hydrated Bloc** as a new method.

4. **[geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) (v13.0.2)**, **[permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) (v11.3.1)**  
   - Used to fetch the user's current location.

5. **[network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/network_image) (v0.1.1)**  
   - Allows rendering images directly from The Weather API.

6. **[http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) (v1.2.2)**  
   - For API calls and fetching weather data.
